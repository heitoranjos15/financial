# scope

I need some interface better than google sheet to save my purchases all of them (market, cellphone, drugs, clothes, billings, tattoo, everything I spend money)

Then I want to see a report to get knowdelege what I spent. (daily, week, month, year, decades)

I want to project future months too, to see how much money I'll have to spend.
